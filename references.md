## Random graphs

The [Wattsâ€“Strogatz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watts_and_Strogatz_model) model is a random graph generation model
that produces graphs with small-world properties, including short [average path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average_path_length) lengths and high [clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clustering_coefficient).
